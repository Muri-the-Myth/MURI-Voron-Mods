# FLUSH z-belt tensioner
Mod designed to improve the quality of life

Adjusting the z-belt tension has cause me headache (not literaly), because I have to screw from a very wierd angle. Thus, I decided to make my life (and hopefully yours) easier by incorporating wing nuts which are easily adjustable.
The 3DP parts are redesigned so that both the m3x16 screw the wing nuts can fit in and neither of them will bump into the top panel.

I end up recognizing that this is a rather stupid idea because, to adjust the tension, you will have to remove the top panel, which actually adds one's workload.
Though, I still published this mod, because there's also a mod about making the removal of the top panel easier, and they can potentially be used in combo (see https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Printopal/Magnetic_top_panel).
